# Welcome Frontend Product Exercise

```
TIMEBOX:    4 hours max. We mean it!
LANGUAGES:  Javascript
FRAMEWORKS: Any libraries you want
```

# Overview

This exercise is to implement the best possible solution to the exercises below in the time alloted. We're evaluating your ability to take a set of requirements and spike a holistic solution that demonstrates craftsmanship, thoughtfulness and attention to user experience. This is **NOT** a test of how well you know a specific framework or ES7+, nor should you try to impress us with overly clever and obtuse solutions or designs. If you want to impress us, build something that is beautiful, intuitive and easy to debug/test/extend :wink: .

Ideally your solution would have some way to run locally and visualize the results in a browser so we can fully analyze the experience and not just the source code.

## Search Airline Offers

### As a user I want to

* Enter shipment details in a form:
  * Origin airport code in the 3-letter format (example: CAI, LAX, MAD)
  * Destination airport in 3-letter format (example: CAI, LAX, MAD)
  * Range of dates (up to 10 days)
  * Weight of the shipment
  
* Display a list of the offers meeting the search criteria
  * **NOTE**: You don't need to create an API to get a list of offers. Use the sample files in [/data](https://github.com/cargo-one/hiring-exercise/blob/main/data) or create your own simple faked data set.
  * **stretch goal**: be able to filter or search by any unique identifiers so I can find specific offers.

* Share a link to my shipment's results via a unique URL
